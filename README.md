Coding Challenge – Text Classification <br>

PART 1 : <br>
German Text Classification Modelling <br>
PART 2 : <br>
REST API using Flask  

Files Uploaded: - <br>
•	<i>Model_Building.ipynb</i> – This file contains the code for Data Modelling   <br>
•	<i>final_model.joblib</i> – This is the saved model that is loaded in the API code. <br>
•	<i>app.py</i> – This is the REST API code which needs to be run on the local computer. <br>
•	<i>templates</i> – Under this folder, <i>index.html</i> file is present. This is a simple front- end webpage where the user gives the text input for prediction. <br>
•	<i>nltk.txt, requirements.txt, Proc</i> – These files are needed for the hosting of the app in Heroku<br>


Note: I have not uploaded the pre-trained german vec files since they are huge. 

Run Instructions : <br>
1. Please download the files 
2. Run the app.py code in the prompt window in the folder location 
3. A local URL displayed can be opened on the web browser and the webpage will appear
4. Feed in the text to get the output label

THE MODEL IS ALSO DEPLOYED ON HEROKU : https://text-classificication.herokuapp.com/
